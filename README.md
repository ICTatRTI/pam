This is an IOS app using the ResearchKit framework for the Ecological Momentary Assessment using the Photographic Affect Meter (PAM).  For more information on PAM please check out [this site](http://idl.cornell.edu/projects/pam/).

The ResearchNet IOS framework can be found [here](https://bitbucket.org/rcdrti/researchnetsdk-ios). Some day you will be able to use a dependency manager like Cocopods to bring this in, but until then you'll have to manually like this by dragging the xcodeprj file (from the Finder) into your project then adding this as an embedded binary under the apps General settings.
